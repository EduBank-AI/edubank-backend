      "text": "**Area Estimation Using Rectangles**\n\n*   **Left Endpoints (L)**\n\n    To estimate the area under the graph of a function using left endpoints with four rectangles of equal width, we need to determine the width of each rectangle and the height based on the left endpoint of each subinterval.\n\n    **Steps:**\n\n    1.  **Divide the Interval:** Divide the interval of interest into four equal subintervals.  Let's assume the interval is `[a, b]`.  Then the width of each rectangle, `Δx`, is:\n\n        ```\n        Δx = (b - a) / 4\n        ```\n\n    2.  **Left Endpoints:** Determine the left endpoint of each subinterval.  Let's call these `x₀, x₁, x₂, x₃`.  They are:\n\n        ```\n        x₀ = a\n        x₁ = a + Δx\n        x₂ = a + 2Δx\n        x₃ = a + 3Δx\n        ```\n\n    3.  **Rectangle Heights:** Evaluate the function at each left endpoint to find the height of each rectangle:\n\n        ```\n        height₁ = f(x₀)\n        height₂ = f(x₁)\n        height₃ = f(x₂)\n        height₄ = f(x₃)\n        ```\n\n    4.  **Calculate Area:**  The area of each rectangle is `height * Δx`.  Sum the areas of the four rectangles to get the estimated area, `L`:\n\n        ```\n        L = Δx * [f(x₀) + f(x₁) + f(x₂) + f(x₃)]\n        ```\n\n    5.  **Overestimation/Underestimation:**\n\n        *   If the function is increasing over the interval, using left endpoints will result in an *underestimation*.\n        *   If the function is decreasing over the interval, using left endpoints will result in an *overestimation*.\n\n*   **Midpoints (M)**\n\n    To estimate the area under the graph of a function using midpoints with four rectangles of equal width, we follow a similar process, but instead of left endpoints, we use the midpoint of each subinterval to determine the height of the rectangle.\n\n    **Steps:**\n\n    1.  **Divide the Interval:** Divide the interval `[a, b]` into four equal subintervals. The width of each rectangle, `Δx`, is:\n\n        ```\n        Δx = (b - a) / 4\n        ```\n\n    2.  **Midpoints:** Determine the midpoint of each subinterval.  Let's call these `m₁, m₂, m₃, m₄`. They are:\n\n        ```\n        m₁ = a + Δx/2\n        m₂ = a + 3Δx/2\n        m₃ = a + 5Δx/2\n        m₄ = a + 7Δx/2\n        ```\n\n    3.  **Rectangle Heights:** Evaluate the function at each midpoint to find the height of each rectangle:\n\n        ```\n        height₁ = f(m₁)\n        height₂ = f(m₂)\n        height₃ = f(m₃)\n        height₄ = f(m₄)\n        ```\n\n    4.  **Calculate Area:**  The area of each rectangle is `height * Δx`.  Sum the areas of the four rectangles to get the estimated area, `M`:\n\n        ```\n        M = Δx * [f(m₁) + f(m₂) + f(m₃) + f(m₄)]\n        ```\n"

      "text": "**Area Approximation with Sample Points**\n\nInstead of using right or left endpoints for the height of our rectangles, we could use the height of the i-th rectangle to be the value of $f$ at any number $x_i^*$ in the i-th subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$. We call the $x_i^*$'s sample points. A more general expression (using the sample points) for the area is:\n\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \\Delta x = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} [f(x_1^*) \\Delta x + f(x_2^*) \\Delta x + \\cdots + f(x_n^*) \\Delta x] $$\n\n```\nf(x)\n0\na  x_0 x_1  ... x_{i-1} x_i ...  b\n```\n\n**Definition of a Definite Integral**\n\nIf f is a function defined for $a \\le x \\le b$, we divide the interval $[a, b]$ into $n$ subintervals of equal width $\\Delta x = \\frac{b-a}{n}$. We let $x_0 = a, x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n = b$ be the endpoints of these subintervals and we let $x_1^*, x_2^*, \\dots, x_n^*$ be any sample points in these subintervals, so $x_i^*$ lies in the i-th subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$. Then the definite integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$ is\n\n$$ \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \\Delta x $$\n\nprovided that this limit exists and gives the same value for all possible choices of sample points. If it does exist, we say that f is integrable on $[a, b]$.\n"
