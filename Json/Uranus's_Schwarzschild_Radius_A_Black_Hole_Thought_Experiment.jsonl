{"text":"**Uranus's Schwarzschild Radius: A Black Hole Thought Experiment** *Introducing Our New Shirt* That's right, our new shirt displays Uranus's Schwarzschild radius in actual size! If Uranus, or anything with its mass, were compressed into a non-rotating ball of this specific width, the gravitational force at its surface would be so intense that even light could not escape. Our new shirt details this phenomenon! *Curiosity Box Subscribers* If you're already subscribed to the Curiosity Box, or subscribe soon, you'll be receiving one of these shirts. *Schwarzschild Radius Explained* A Schwarzschild radius exists for every mass. * For the Sun, it's approximately 3 km. * For you, it's about 10^-25 meters, smaller than an atomic nucleus. * For Earth, it's 8.87 mm. *Our Multi-Tool Gauge* You'll never forget Earth's Schwarzschild radius thanks to this gauge on our multi-tool. *A Moment of Levity* If you ever feel down, and as if nothing is going right, just place this card on the ground. If Earth does not fit through this hole, it means it's not a black hole yet, which is fantastic!"}
