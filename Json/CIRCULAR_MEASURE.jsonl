{"text":"CIRCULAR MEASURE **Linear Displacement:** Displacement in a straight line. **Linear Velocity:** Rate of change of angular displacement. **Angular Displacement:** Angle subtended at the center when an object moves from position A to position B on a circular track. **Angular velocity:** Rate of change of angular displacement. w = θ / t For complete revolution v = rw → linear velocity Z *Diagram of circular motion with radius R, axis of rotation, and points X, Y, Z* - X, Y, Z have the same angular velocity - Vx \u003e Vy \u003e Vz as V = rw considering radius ω = 2π/T | ω = 2πf **Centripetal Force:** Force required for an object to move in a circle. Is directed towards the center of the circle. Fc = mv²/r Fc = mrω² Fc = mvω **Centripetal Acceleration:** F = ma ma= mv²/r ma = mrω² ma = mvω a = vω a = v²/r a = rω² **Conical Pendulum** 1. Fc = Tsinθ T = Fc/sinθ T = Fc/sinθ tanθ = Fc/mg tanθ = v²/rg tanθ = rω²/g ω = √(g/(rcosθ)) 2. W = Tcosθ T = W/cosθ **Radian:** Angle suspended at the center of a circle by an arc equal to its radius. **Horizontal Circular Motion** **Vertical Circular Motion** θ = 180° Tmax = mv²/r + mg cos(180°) Tmax = mv²/r - mg θ = 270° Tmax = mv²/r + mg cos(270°) Tmax = mv²/r θ = 90° Tmax = mv²/r + mg cos(90°) Tmax = mv²/r θ = 0° Fc = T - Wcosθ T = Fc + Wcosθ Tmax = mv²/r + mg cos(0°) Tmax = mv²/r + mg"}
